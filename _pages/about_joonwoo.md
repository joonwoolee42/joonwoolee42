### **Joon-Woo Lee**

I am an assistant professor in School of Computer Science and Engineering at Chung-Ang University since September 2022. Before joining Chung-Ang University, I obtained my Ph.D. in Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Seoul National University advised by Jong-Seon No in August 2022.

My research interests are privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML) with cryptographic tools. During my graduate course at SNU, I have been working mainly on primitives in fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), advanced algorithms on FHE, and efficient PPML with deep neural networks. I am also interested in hardware optimization for PPML on FHE and practical implementation of PPML for AI-as-a-service (AIaaS) cloud systems. 

Other research interests are post-quantum cryptography (PQC), multi-party computation (MPC), and advanced lattice-based encryption schemes.
