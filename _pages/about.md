Private Artificial Intelligence and Cryptography Lab (PAICLAB), part of the School of Computer Science and Engineering at Chung-Ang University, is a next-generation security research team dedicated to addressing security and privacy issues emerging in the era of the 4th Industrial Revolution, driven by artificial intelligence and cloud technology. While various industries are rapidly advancing with AI technology at the forefront, it is challenging to successfully apply the state-of-the-art technologies without resolving security issues. We welcome anyone who is interested in learning about the state-of-the-art security technologies and participating at the forefront of next-generation security research. If you are interested in our research direction, please contact jwlee2815@cau.ac.kr!
